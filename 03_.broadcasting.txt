Fanout exchange it's not a default exchange, so we need to create it explicitly.
Additionally, we need to create these different queues and bindings between the 
queues and fanout exchange.


Queue remains lingering.
The queue was not deleted, even if the subscriber got completed or interrupted.
Now, how to solve this problem?
Queue has exclusive connection to a channel, so queue will be deleted a 
as soon as the corresponding channel is closed
Now, since this is exclusive to the subscriber, Therefore, now all the 
subscribers, they need to have unique names as well in the broker.
So best solution is Temporary queues
RabbitMQ choose the queue name when the subscriber created, so subscriber 
does not specify the actual name at all. And after the queue has been created, 
the subscriber can get access to the name using the available APIs and then 
use this name to specify the binding between the queue and the exchange.
