default exchange - one to one connection
fanout exchange - broadcast
selective exchange(direct exchange) - multicast, like vlans

Minuses of Fanout Exchange:
- this reduces the performance of the subscriber as it gets busy in filtering 
the required messages
- every subscriber will receive all the messages which may be confidential
for the intended subscriber - raises a serious security concern in the system

Selection Routing - Example (picture)
We define for routing keys - error, warning info and others
Exchange filters the incoming messages based upon the binding rules and 
sends the messages to the intended recipient only.
Since the exchange does not have any binding rule for the other routing key
- they get dropped


Selection Routing - Example2 (picture)
One subscriber is interested in the messages for more than one routing key
One subscriber is creating more than one binding in the exchange for the 
routing key it interested in receive. So there are more than one binding 
for one particular queue in these binding rules.

So publishers need not be aware now how messages are being processed and 
who is processing them. Publishers need not be aware of any subscriber 
or it's a message queue.

If there is no binding rules for routing key - msg with this type of routing
key will be dropped
