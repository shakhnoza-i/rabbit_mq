Subscriber binding problems(picture)
Just by combining the different pieces of information in a single routing, 
it does not solve the subscriber side of the problem

Solution - binding rule syntax (picture)
Very same to regular expressions
* - to match exactly a single word
# - to match zero or more words.
Example â„–3: 3 way to define a binding rule (#.A3# - is a more of flexible rule)

So when you are developing a product, you need to consider what aspects are 
important for your product and design it accordingly.


11. Bindings loss (picture)
What happens next is that the publisher deletes the exchange now when the 
publisher has deleted. The subscriber is still there.
And after that, when the publisher comes back. It creates the exchange, posted 
the messages to it. But this time, the bindings have been already lost.

So therefore, whenever you are designing your system, you need to ensure 
that the exchange and the binding creations are done properly and exchange 
doesn't get deleted unnecessarily because this was a very important point.
