Failure points (picture)
Deployment of Rabbit MQ system where the publisher, broker and subscribers
are deployed on different machines, this system gets a few failure points.

1) Connection/Channel may go down

2) Exchange may go down or restart

3) Queue may go down or restart

Problems in queue-subscriber point
4) When a subscriber receives a message, it has to acknowledge it back to the
queue so that it can be deleted from the queue and the acknowledgement can 
be automatic or manual. 
In case of automatic acknowledgement. May happen is that subscriber has 
automatically acknowledged the message to the queue, but haven't processed 
it so far. And before it completes the processing of this message, it goes 
down.
5) Next problem is that if we have fewer subscribers attached to the same 
message queue. Now, what if a particular subscriber is continuously receiving 
the heavy messages by having messages, whereas the other subscribers will not 
be that much overloaded. By default, the queue send the messages to it 
attached subscriber in a round robin fashion. However, this particular mechanism 
can be changed. RabbitMQ gives us a provision to select how many messages can be 
sent to a subscriber before we get the acknowledgement back from.
